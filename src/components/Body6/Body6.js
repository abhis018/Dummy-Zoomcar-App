                    Kolkata, the 'City of Joy', is bustling with activity throughout the day. It is home to working professionals who come here from other cities or countries, as well as tourists on holiday. The only obstacle in their well-planned schedule is the mode of transportation. They need a reliable mode of transport which will allow them to travel to any corner of the city at any given point of time.<br/>
