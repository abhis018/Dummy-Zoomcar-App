                The experience with Zoomcar has been excellent. Your process is well thought out and the service definitely fills a void. 
                Maybe you could start a school which teaches "real customer service"!

                I have loved your concept since the time I saw it online. Now, after using your services, 
                this concept is wonderful and a delight to all customers. A service in other major cities
                 would go a long way in establishing your brand as well as loyalty of customers.

                I belong to Mumbai and am currently based out of Pune. I have used many such services like Carzonrent, 
                Girikand, Autodrive while being here but none have matched the convenience, affordability as well as efficiency of your service.

                Excellent customer service. Would highly recommend ZOOM to anybody who is in need of self drive cars. 
                Would be great if they start opening more pick up points throughout bangalore

                Select your car. Pay. Drive. Return. The zoomcar booking process is as simple as this. 
                Butter cannot be smoother than this.
